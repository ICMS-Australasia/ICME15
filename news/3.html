                            <p>The holiday season is nearly upon us, but the International Program Committee (IPC) is still hard at work finalising TSG and Survey teams and preparing for the next IPC meeting which will be held in Sydney in February 2023. Whilst ICME-15 may feel far off for some, there are now just six months until registrations officially open with much to do before then!</p>
                            <p>We’ve received some tremendous feedback following the release of the First Announcement in October – my sincere thanks to everyone who reached out. If you’re eager to be counted at ICME-15, we have some exciting news in this newsletter about Discussion Groups proposals and volunteer opportunities. The deadline for National Presentation applications is also fast approaching: read on to find out when to submit your application.</p>
                            <p>On behalf of the IPC, I’d like to wish you a festive holiday season filled with relaxation and happy memories. We look forward to sharing more of our plans for ICME-15 in the new year.</p>

                            <p>At each ICME, a small set of countries and regions highlight their achievements and challenges in mathematics education by presenting a snapshot of important areas of scholarship and work. These 90-minute presentations typically consist of a series of oral presentations and include time for questions and discussion.</p>
                            <p>Countries and regions are invited to submit an application to give a National Presentation at the ICME-15 Congress using <a href="https://icmsaust.eventsair.com/icme-15/nationalpresentation/Site/Register" target="_blank">this form</a> before 31 December 2022. Applications should be submitted by the National Representatives of ICMI member states, or academic groups representing ICMI member states.</p>
                            <p>The IPC will select National Presentations for inclusion at ICME-15 during their next meeting in February 2023 meeting. A list of the National Presentations will be included in the Second Announcement.</p>

                            <p>Discussion Groups gather Congress participants who are interested in discussing challenging, controversial, or emerging issues of interest with an international audience in a genuinely interactive way.</p>
                            <p>The IPC consider Discussion Groups as integral to fostering international collaboration and sharing on topics that are of importance and relevance to Congress participants from different countries.</p>
                            <p>Hosting a Congress Discussion Group is a unique and rewarding opportunity, so to encourage as many proposals as possible, we have chosen to open applications early!</p>
                            <p>Proposals can continue to be refined and further developed over the coming year once submitted – <a href="https://icmsaust.eventsair.com/icme-15/discussiongroup/Site/Register" target="_blank">click here</a> to begin your proposal.</p>
