                        <h3>Invitation from the International Program Committee</h3>
                        <p>On behalf of the International Program Committee for ICME-15, it is an honour and a great pleasure for me to invite you to what will be a truly unique and exciting initiative for mathematics and statistics education in Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world.</p>
                        <p>Our aim is for ICME-15 to be an inclusive event at which people who are passionate about mathematics and statistics education can come together and connect with like-minded colleagues from around the globe – to create lasting local, regional and global legacies in our field.</p>
                            <p>The IPC has high ambitions for the Congress – we are working towards a Congress that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Addresses geographic and other forms of disadvantage in relation to mathematics teaching and learning</li>
                            <li>Has a central focus on Indigenous mathematics informing global efforts in mathematics education</li>
                            <li>Includes a focus on undergraduate teaching of mathematics and statistics</li>
                            <li>Has an impact in classrooms by informing the work of teachers</li>
                            <li>Facilitates and supports people-to-people connections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I look forward to keeping you informed of progress with ICME-15 over the coming months and, ultimately welcoming you to Sydney in 2024. Together we will make ICME-15 a resounding success. Come and be counted!</p>

                        <p>Through ICME-15, we can share our practices and experiences, learn from each other, and find common ground for advancing mathematics education in the Asia Pacific region and across the globe by providing a platform to address the challenges for mathematics education shared by many countries.</p>
                        <p>A successful Congress relies on the valued support provided by sponsors and exhibitors.</p>
                        <p>A Prospectus of opportunities will be available shortly where we can begin to lay the foundations for a reciprocal relationship, cementing your commitment to promoting the Congress internally and to your networks.  This may be through your ongoing work, or a new initiative you can tap into the Congress to promote through this prestigious International event.</p>
