                        <h3>Invitation from the International Program Committee</h3>
                        <p>On behalf of the International Program Committee for ICME-15, it is an honour and a great pleasure for me to invite you to what will be a truly unique and exciting initiative for mathematics and statistics education in Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world.</p>
                        <p>Our aim is for ICME-15 to be an inclusive event at which people who are passionate about mathematics and statistics education can come together and connect with like-minded colleagues from around the globe â€“ to create lasting local, regional and global legacies in our field. The IPC has high ambitions for the Congress. We are working towards a Congress that, among other things:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Addresses geographic and other forms of disadvantage in relation to mathematics teaching and learning</li>
                            <li>Has a central focus on Indigenous mathematics informing global efforts in mathematics education</li>
                            <li>Includes a focus on undergraduate teaching of mathematics and statistics</li>
                            <li>Has an impact in classrooms by informing the work of teachers</li>
                            <li>Facilitates and supports people-to-people connections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I look forward to keeping you informed of progress with ICME-15 over the coming months and, ultimately greeting you in Sydney. Together we will make ICME-15 a resounding success. Come and be counted!</p>

                        <p>Through ICME-15, we can share our practices and experiences, learn from each other, and find common ground for advancing mathematics education in the Asia Pacific region and across the globe by providing a platform to address the challenges for mathematics education shared by many countries.</p>
                        <p>A successful Congress relies on the valued support provided by sponsors and exhibitors.</p>
                        <p>A Prospectus of opportunities will be available shortly where we can begin to lay the foundations for reciprocal relationship, cementing your commitment to promoting the Congress internally and to your networks.  This may be through your ongoing work, or a new initiative you can tap into the Congress to promote through this prestigious International event.</p>
                        <p>If you would like to receive a copy directly, please email <a href = "mailto:emmab@icmsaust.com.au">emmab@icmsaust.com.au</a> to discuss ways in which your organisation can best leverage from this Congress.</p>
